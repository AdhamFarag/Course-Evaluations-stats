# COURSE EVALUATIONS STATS
## Gathering the data
In this project we used `collect data.py` to get the data from the course evaluations provided
> #### How to use `collect data.py`
> Put the file into a folder containing all the course evaluations pdf and run the py file. it will then procceed to collect the data from the files in that folder and add it to a data.csv file
> #### Issues faced using this script
> some parts of data were not collected, but considering it being very little data it can be added manually by re-tracing it to its original file (course evaluation pdf) and and adding the missing values to the csv file using excel
